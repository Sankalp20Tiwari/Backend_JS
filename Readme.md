## 📖 Overview
This is the backend for a web application, built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**. It provides APIs for authentication, user management, and data handling. The backend is designed to be secure, scalable, and easy to integrate with front-end applications.

## 🚀 Features
- **User authentication**: Implements JWT-based login & signup with hashed passwords for security.
- **Role-based access control**: Allows defining different roles and permissions for users.
- **CRUD operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing data efficiently.
- **API rate limiting**: Prevents abuse and enhances security by limiting excessive requests.
- **Environment-based configuration management**: Supports different environments (development, production) through `.env` files.
- **Cloudinary integration**: Handles image uploads efficiently using Cloudinary services.

## 🛠️ Installation
### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest LTS version recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (if running locally)
- A Cloudinary account (if using image uploads)

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sankalp20Tiwari/Backend_JS.git
cd backend
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### 4️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.sample`:
```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```
Update the `.env` file with your specific configuration.

#### 📌 Required Environment Variables
```env
PORT = <Server port>
MONGODB_URI = <MongoDB connection string>
CORS_ORIGIN = <Allowed frontend domain>
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = <Secret key for JWT tokens>
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY = <JWT token expiry time>
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET = <Secret key for refresh tokens>
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY = <Refresh token expiry time>

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = <Your Cloudinary cloud name>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = <Your Cloudinary API key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = <Your Cloudinary API secret>
```

### 5️⃣ Run the Server
```sh
npm start
```
The server will start at `http://localhost:5000`

## 🔥 API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint         | Description         |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| POST   | /api/auth/signup | Register a new user |
| POST   | /api/auth/login  | Authenticate user   |
| GET    | /api/users       | Fetch all users     |
| POST   | /api/upload      | Upload an image to Cloudinary |

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- **Use strong secrets**: Always generate strong secrets for JWT and refresh tokens.
- **Enable CORS carefully**: Restrict allowed origins to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Use environment variables**: Never expose sensitive information in source code.
- **Rate limiting**: Ensures the API is not abused by implementing request throttling.
